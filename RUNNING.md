#RUNNING

Running the app can be done easily through SCIDE, but you can also run a node js file monitor for more rapid development of large projects.

- run "yarn install" to install dependencies
- run "npm start" to start the app, run "npm watch" to watch for file changes and restart as needed (preferred method).
